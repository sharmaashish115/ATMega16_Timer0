# ATMega16_Timer0
This code snippet demonstrates an example of using the AVR microcontroller with the ATmega series, specifically utilizing Timer/Counter0 and interrupts.

1. The code includes two header files: `avr/io.h` and `avr/interrupt.h`. These headers provide access to AVR-specific input/output and interrupt handling functions and definitions.

2. The declaration `volatile uint8_t count;` defines a global variable `count` of type `uint8_t`, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer. The `volatile` keyword indicates that the variable can be modified by external factors, such as interrupts, and its value may change unexpectedly.

3. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It configures the microcontroller's registers and enables interrupts.

4. `DDRD |= (1<<6);` sets the 6th bit of the `DDRD` register, configuring pin D6 (Digital Pin 6) of the AVR microcontroller as an output pin. This allows toggling its state later in the code.

5. `TCNT0 = 0;` sets the value of Timer/Counter0 (TCNT0) to 0. This register is responsible for counting timer ticks.

6. `count = 0;` initializes the `count` variable to 0.

7. `TCCR0 &= ~(1<<CS01);` clears the second bit (CS01) of the Timer/Counter0 Control Register (TCCR0), effectively disabling the clock source for Timer/Counter0. This step ensures that Timer/Counter0 is not running until explicitly configured.

8. `TCCR0 |= (1<<CS02) | (1<<CS00);` sets the first (CS00) and third (CS02) bits of TCCR0, selecting a clock source for Timer/Counter0. Here, it sets the prescaler to divide the system clock by 1024, which will be the clock source for Timer/Counter0.

9. `TIMSK |= 1<<TOIE0;` sets the first bit (TOIE0) of the Timer/Counter0 Interrupt Mask Register (TIMSK). This enables the Timer/Counter0 overflow interrupt, which will trigger an interrupt when TCNT0 overflows from 255 to 0.

10. `sei();` enables global interrupts by setting the global interrupt enable bit in the Status Register (SREG). This step allows the microcontroller to respond to interrupts.

11. The code enters an infinite `while` loop (`while (1) { ... }`), where it waits for interrupts to occur. Since there is no code inside the loop, the program effectively stalls here.

12. The `ISR(TIMER0_OVF_vect)` is an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) that handles the Timer/Counter0 overflow interrupt. When the interrupt is triggered, the microcontroller jumps to this ISR to execute the corresponding code.

13. Inside the ISR, the condition `if (count == 31)` checks if `count` has reached the value of 31. If so, it toggles the state of pin D6 (PORTD ^= (1<<6)) using the bitwise XOR operator, and resets `count` to 0.

14. If `count` is not equal to 31, the `else` block increments `count` by 1.

Overall, this code initializes Timer/Counter0, enables its overflow interrupt, and toggles an output pin (D6) on every 32nd interrupt occurrence, creating a periodic square wave signal.
